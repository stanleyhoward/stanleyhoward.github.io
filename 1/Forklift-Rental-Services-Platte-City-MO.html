<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>Raymond's ACR System (advanced AC motor control system) delivers powerful AC drive and lift that reduces downtime and increases warehouse productivity enabling faster, smoother operation while increasing operator confidence and lowering total cost of ownership. First, body lift kits are simple and straightforward in application and use. That includes lift kits for different trucks to get you set up for whatever adventure you have planned.</p>

<p>Body lift kits also allow the owner to keep the factory suspension installed and don't require any significant alterations to your truck's shape. The pallet trucks with platforms have comprehensive suspension.

The maximum allowable load should be clearly marked on the nameplate of the forklift truck.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>It will allow you to efficiently pick goods on a pallet and quickly move from rack to rack as well as give you the ability to drive the lifter into a container in order to unload goods.
