<h2>Pallet Truck Lifting Equipment Florence</h2>
<p>Ergonomics, operator fatigue, labor shortage and undesirable working conditions are all factors impacting the future of forklifts. Whatever your reasons for looking for a forklift rental near me”, Altorfer Lift Truck has the equipment you need to get the job done right. A more fuel efficient lift truck may save more than the monthly payment of the used forklift for sale.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Telescopic Handler forklifts are ideal for agriculture and anything that requires high lifting. Hand Pallet Trucks are equipped with quality materials, offering its high strength and durability. Trucks can be outfitted with forks for pallet-based unit load picking , or with a variety of attachments—such as platforms, grippers or clamps—for handling loads that are not palletized.</p>
