<p>BVA offers a wide range of industrial products to suit any industry including construction, mining, oil, forestry, foundation repair, MRO, OEMs and more. The dashboards of forklifts today use computers. Our rental lift trucks are maintained to the industry's highest standards and undergo comprehensive pre-rental inspections to ensure consistent performance and reliable operations. Before choosing a standup forklift, it's important to determine the size of the typical load that you will be lifting.
