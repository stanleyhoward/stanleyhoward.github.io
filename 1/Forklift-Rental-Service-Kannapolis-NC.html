You can find Counterbalance Forklift Truck Driver jobs in Knowsley Industrial Park, Kirkby Ind Est, Kirkby Industrial Estate and Kirkby (L32). Welcome to Dave Arbogast Lifted Trucks, located in Troy, Ohio. Three-wheeled counterbalance forklifts are mainly used in warehouses and loading docks where there isn't much room for maneuvering or turning.</p>
<p>The load limit is shown on the data plate of the lift truck. Monster street truck drivers are at the distinct disadvantage in close quarters when maneuvering, such as in stop-and-go driving, city traffic, and even parking.
