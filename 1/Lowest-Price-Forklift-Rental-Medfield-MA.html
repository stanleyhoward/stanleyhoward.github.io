<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

If you see anything you want to learn more about before visiting, our sales and service staff welcome your calls.</p>
<p>Rough Terrain Forklift Safety Training Matters. Test N5 - both reach and straddle trucks (except with tilting mast) - stability is usually obvious, in which case test may be waived. Browse our selection of lifted Ford, Chevy, and Dodge lifted trucks. Faster travel, lift and lower speeds reduce order picking time, the most labour intensive materials handling function.</p>
<h2>Reach Fork Truck Medfield</h2>
<p>The full line of Yale robotic lift trucks uses infrastructure-free navigation technology, which requires no installation of wires, magnets or tape. The ZR2 has increased clearance, a transfer case shield, front frame-mounted tow hooks, and 17-inch wheels with Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac maximum traction tires.

For a full 25-foot (7.6 m) forward reach, the load capacity of this forklift is reduced to 2,000 pounds (908 kg) without outriggers, or stabilizing legs, and 3,250 pounds (148 kg) with outriggers.</p>
<p>The weight of Best Value Pallet Truck, Pallet Jack 5500 lb. Capacity 27 x 48 is 159lbs. That give rise to the forklift trucks demand.

Integral sideshift allows sideways movement of the forks to handle loads that may not be aligned with the truck. Whether you're looking for a new or used battery, a rental or you just need some spare parts, Mid-Ohio Forklifts has got you covered.</p>
