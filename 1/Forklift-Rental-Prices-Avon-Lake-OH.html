In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Yes, it's going to be harder to get in and out of your truck, but a twisted ankle or scraped knee is a small price to pay compared to a truck body rocketing off of its suspension due to some shoddy craftsmanship.
