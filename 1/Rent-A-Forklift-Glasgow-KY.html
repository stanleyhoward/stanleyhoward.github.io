Some forklifts use a single hydraulic cylinder to elevate the boom, while others use two cylinders. While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects.</p>
<p>Some dealers will sell lifted trucks, but you may be more likely to find them through alternative means, like custom shops.
