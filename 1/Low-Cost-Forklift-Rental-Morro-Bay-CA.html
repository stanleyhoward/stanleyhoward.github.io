<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet.

Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of order pickers.</p>
<h2>How High Will a Telescopic Forklift Go in Morro Bay </h2>
<p>If you rent forklift then it will work as a power based truck to lift and move industrial and raw materials.

<p>Easily movable sidegates allow operators to open the case-picking window, helping them to be more productive. Battery and charger included with rentals. If alternate capacities are shown for elevations lower than maximum, alternate capacities not shown may be 2 assumed to fall on a straight line between the capacity and the alternate capacities shown for each load center.</p>
