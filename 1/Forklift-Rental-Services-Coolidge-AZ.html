Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab.

When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials.
