<p>Clear Lake off-roaders know that for the best performance - and unbeatable styling - nothing beats a lifted RAM 1500 There are many ways to lift your truck - the right one will depend on how you plan to use it and your budget Below we cover two of the most common types of lifts, and the steps you should follow if you don't plan on coming to a body shop for help.</p>
