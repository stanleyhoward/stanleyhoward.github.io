<p>Not ready to buy new but need a material handling solution right away we have a good selection of used material handling equipment to choose from on a regular basis. A lifted truck with a higher center of gravity is not going to handle the way a stock truck with a lower center of gravity is. Forget tight turns and swift maneuvering on a lifted truck. Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst. Designed for heavy loads, high reach, and extreme maneuverability, a forklift can make quick work of moving, loading, storing and unloading all sorts of loads.</p>
<p>161 Rule: Vehicles will not be driven in and out of trucks trailers at unloading docks until trucks are securely blocked and brakes set.

See all our counterbalance and reach forklift trucks. Whether you know that lifted trucks are your thing or you are still looking at all of your choices and trying to make a decision, we are here to help.</p>
<h2>How to Determine the Value of a Used Forklift in Cedar </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
