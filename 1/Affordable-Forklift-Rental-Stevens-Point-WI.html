<p>In addition, one should always check the capacity plate as it gives important information for how heavy a load the forklift can handle, as well as information about the tires, tilt degrees and other knowledge necessary to safe operating.

<p>Yes, it's going to be harder to get in and out of your truck, but a twisted ankle or scraped knee is a small price to pay compared to a truck body rocketing off of its suspension due to some shoddy craftsmanship. This Rough Terrain Forklift Train the Trainer course provides your employees with proper instruction techniques, so your trainer will be able to demonstrate and relay important procedures to the rest of your crews during future onsite trainings.</p>
<p>Beyond the size and power source, when choosing a forklift you need to evaluate a variety of factors that impact your long-term cost, including how much and how high the machine can lift, how careful you need to be when manipulating the load in sensitive areas and whether you should buy or rent a forklift. The Multi-Task Control Handle allows operators to manage travel direction and speed while maneuvering during lift and reach operations.</p>
