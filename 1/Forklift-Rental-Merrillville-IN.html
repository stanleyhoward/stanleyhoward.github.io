It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>Pro Comp offers a selection of lift kits for almost every major make and model truck or suv.

<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.” KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015. The most obvious benefit is the increased ground clearance when driving over rugged terrain, which reduces the risk of damage to your undercarriage.</p>
<h2>Pallet Jack Merrillville</h2>
<p>All personnel required to operate a Industrial Counterbalance Forklift Truck should complete this training and testing. It is also backed with priority support from our nationwide team of field service forklift technicians.

<p>Reach trucks are industrial vehicles used in material handling applications for industrial manufacturing, distribution, electronics, logistics, textiles, consumers, steel, granite, construction and more.

<p>When driving rough terrain forklifts, safety should always come first. Employers who fail to have their workers properly trained and licensed to operate forklifts in the workplace expose themselves to expensive OSHA fines and severe penalties. Also, the use of technologically well-versed forklift trucks in this region is gaining maximum traction and supplementing the growth of the truck industry.</p>
<p>While they may look like cars, forklifts drive differently being that they utilize rear-wheel steering, which helps maneuverability in tight quarters.
