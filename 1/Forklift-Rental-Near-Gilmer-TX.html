<p>We have access to many brands, so we will have a Forklift solution that fits your requirements. Available for a majority of popular trucks including the 1500 Silverado and the Ram 2500, Fabtech makes sure your truck gets lifted the right way without taking any shortcuts. With lift heights of up to 8.5 meters and load capacities from 1.2 to 3 tons, the Toyota 7FBRE series, 8FBRE series and BT Reflex series offers truck models suitable for block stacking, drive-in racking, and long load handling.</p>
<p>If you do decide to go ahead and lift your truck, take extra care when operating it to ensure safety, and check everything underneath regularly for wear and tear to prevent and accelerated damage that may occur. However, the term rough terrain” does not imply that the forklift can be safely operated on every conceivable type of terrain. If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>

That is what we have taken that out of the equation for you, with our delivery service for all new machinery and forklift rentals in our range.</p>

We have a team of sales executives that are responsible for offering product information on our wide range of new Heli forklifts. Hand trucks lift the load a few inches off the ground, so they meant to be carrying things for long distances or extended periods.</p>
<p>We replace your lead-acid battery-powered electric trucks - regardless of manufacturer or brand - with our EFG with lithium-ion batteries. Most Forklift Dealers will provide operator training (sometimes with a cost) with the purchase of a new forklift.

<p>At least 22% of these deaths were caused by forklift overturns and another 20% to workers on foot being struck by the forklift. In honor of National Forklift Safety Day on June 12, we present our annual ranking of the 10 (actually, 11 due to a tie for 10th place) largest global manufacturers of forklifts, as ranked by revenue. Pallet jacks can bear a lot of weight, but they also have limits that cannot be safely exceeded.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>If you do not have recharging stations in your facility, Class IV forklifts are the next best alternatives. Our inventory of small and large rental equipment includes solutions for difficult climates, visibility blockers, tough terrain, high spaces and unique situations. If you are renting an electric truck, and do not have the time to idle the truck for charging request a second battery.</p>
