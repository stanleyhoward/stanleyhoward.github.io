<p>Navigating narrow warehouse aisles while working close alongside shelves and racks of products can expose operators to have counterbalance forklift license training. Founded in 1987 as a sales and service provider for materials handling equipment, Lift West Limited is now part of the Dunstall Holdings Group. Dimensioning devices - fork truck-mounted dimensioning systems provide dimensions for the cargo to facilitate truck trailer space utilization and to support warehouse automation systems.</p>
<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop.

Body lift kits are also typically the least expensive option when looking to lift a truck; however, a gap is created by the spacer between the body and frame.
