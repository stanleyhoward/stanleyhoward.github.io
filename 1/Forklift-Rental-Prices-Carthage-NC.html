Telehandlers look and function like forklifts, but have a telescopic boom that can extend forwards and upwards for different attachments, such as a bucket, pallet forks, or muck grab. If the forklift truck in front is driving too slow.

Use high-quality assembly from industry's mature suppliers to ensure the function of the truck's power system and its stability.
