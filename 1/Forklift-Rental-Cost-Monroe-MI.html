This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>Rough terrain forklifts can have a vertical tower, which lifts loads straight up, or a telescoping boom, which lifts loads up and out from the base of the machine. Maini's floor transportation range enables effortless transfer of heavy loads in your shop floors and warehouses. Motorized pallet jacks or manual pallet jacks are found in nearly every warehouse and are essential in many manufacturing and distribution work environments.</p>
<p>Designed for medium lifts, the JX2 would make a reliable and safe addition to any warehouse, maintenance centre or shop floor. Our industrial counterbalance forklift truck training course is accredited by RTITB and will provide learners with the basic knowledge and practical skills involved in safely operating an industrial counterbalance forklift truck. One of the most important tests on a forklift is the American Society of Mechanical Engineers stability test.</p>
