<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Why not check out our selection of used forklifts or contact us for more information. Not work on a forklift platform unless the industrial lift truck is on a firm flat surface and the platform is equipped with guardrails or a travel restraint system or fall-arresting system. For electric lift trucks and batteries, you'll want to review the battery charger requirements.</p>
