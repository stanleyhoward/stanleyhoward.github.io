When your load is sitting on pallets, the forklift prongs can fit easily into the pallet to move and carry your heavy load rapidly.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying rated capacity load at full rearward tilt of the mast and with the load elevated 12 inches from the floor, measured at the point of intersection of the load carrying surfaces of the forks, shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to an 18 percent slope about an axis parallel to the axis of the load wheels and in a direction to increase the load overhang.</p>

It has a certain vibe about it that says, I'm here, I'm big, and you should probably get out of my way.” Whether you're going for a little lift to help you gauge more rugged terrain, or a megalift for that monster truck street cred, a lifted truck involves a lot of considerations.</p>
<p>Driving with the load downhill can result in loss of the load and control of the forklift. Efficient, versatile and productive, Raymond Counterbalanced Lift Trucks perform at the highest levels.

Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks. The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>If you are thinking of increasing the ride height of your truck, a stronger sway bar should be mandatory.
