<p>TYPES OF FORKLIFTS: fork crane models for industrial use within warehouses, hydraulic three-wheeled electric forklifts, etc. These types of forklifts can accelerate and travel at higher speeds, which also makes them ideal for outdoor uses. More elaborate lift kits not only raise the body of your truck up but can also increase the clearance of your truck's frame and let you put bigger tires on your pickup. Take a closer look at the most important features to find out how rough terrain forklifts get the job done.</p>
<p>The following particularly applies to pallet trucks with a platform: Many ergonomic elements and functions make it easier to operate the truck.
