<p>For the development of modern Forklift Trucks, Hyster-Yale Materials plays a major role in bringing the connected device technology across the trucking industry. Some forklifts use a single hydraulic cylinder to elevate the boom, while others use two cylinders. While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects.</p>
<p>Sharing a chassis with the 7300 series "severe-service" truck, it comes from the factory with a permanent all-wheel drive train, heavy duty anti-lock air drum brakes, and either a 7.6L or 8.7L inline six cylinder turbo diesels. Designed to work specifically indoors in tight access environments like high density warehousing, standup forklifts offer a number of efficiency enhancing features that are not available on the "general use" standard sit-down forklift.</p>
