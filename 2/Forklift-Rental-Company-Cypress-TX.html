<p>When standard pallet sizes launched in 1930, forklifts became even more useful.

Affordability - Rental forklift is highly affordable; you can rent a high-capacity forklift at a very reasonable cost.</p>

Larger items may be attached to a pallet or have indents for fork lifting built into the item itself. Manufacturing Areas: While rough terrain forklifts aren't designed for indoor use, you can put them to work in enclosed spaces.</p>
<p>Other narrow aisle trucks include stand up straddles, swing masts, side loaders, and turret trucks. Lifting loads became an easier process, and the addition of a crane helped workers to pack forklifts quickly. The suspension lift kit helps drivers conquer uneven and off-road terrain.
