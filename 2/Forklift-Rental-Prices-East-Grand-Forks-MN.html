<p>Safety requirements relating to the elements of design, operation and maintenance of powered industrial trucks - not including vehicles intended primarily for earth moving or over the road hauling.

<p>Forklift rental also helps manage capital expenditure. In a crash with a lifted car, this show of force can become a terrifying reality. Besides, forklift training offers the operator the latest maneuvering and handling skills needed to increase efficiency.
