<p>Ziglift Material Handling is committed to your material handling needs and is open to service our essential business customers. There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture.

Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>

<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift. Before you select any hydraulic pump, however, there are several important pieces of information to take into consideration that will help you match it with the right hydraulic tool, cylinder, or equipment.</p>
<p>Our order pickers are available in brands you can trust such as Unicarriers, EP Equipment and Xilin and are backed by 100% after sales service and support. The dual path is perfect for that driver who carries more weight on one side of their truck than the other. Rough terrain forklifts have increased traction on the tyres for navigation over poor terrain. Always start the engine while seated in the operator's position—never while standing alongside the forklift.</p>

If you are planning to go for one of the above kinds of pallet trucks, CUMI LIFT has a range of it, you can pick the one that most suits your needs.
