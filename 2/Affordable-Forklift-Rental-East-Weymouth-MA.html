<h2>Drum Poly Deck With Pallet Jack Pockets East Weymouth </h2>
<p>Common industries that use these types of forklifts include lumber yards, metal yards, and shipping ports. Class six forklifts can utilize either internal combustion engines for outdoor use or battery powered electric motors for indoor use.

The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
