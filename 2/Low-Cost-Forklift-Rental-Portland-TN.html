<p>A lift kit can have a serious impact on your off-road driving. Additionally, buying your forklifts allows your drivers to get used to one vehicle, rather than learning how to use different trucks every few weeks or months. A walk-behind narrow aisle lift truck with a 3,000 to 4,000 pound capacity costs approximately $15,000 to $18,000. Lifted trucks with a body lift have physical spacers or blocks installed between the body and the frame of the truck.</p>

The main safety concern pertains to the lifted vehicle's bumper height from the ground. Having completed the required Rough Terrain Forklift Training will also keep your company in compliance. Forklifts are most often used in the warehouses.</p>
