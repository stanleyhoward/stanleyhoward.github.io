<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb.

Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>

Winners of the FLTA â€˜Archie' in Safety Excellence for the Pro 5 Series of Electric Trucks with its inbuilt Auto-Slow Down function.

With the installation of a suspension lift, however, you can get a lot greater clearance. Mono Tube shocks with reservoir cylinder are constructed with off-road attitude and performance in mind. All terrain forklifts allow you to work in places where traditional forklifts cannot go.

No forklift operator can predict every possible event.</p>
<p>In addition our finance department has warranties that can give you peace of mind with your new lifted truck. In most instances, renting a forklift makes more sense than buying one. Whenever a truck is equipped with vertical only, or vertical and horizontal travel controls elevatable with the lifting carriage or forks for lifting personnel, the following additional precautions should be taken for the protection of personnel being elevated.</p>
<p>Easy to programme and fully configurable, the BT Reflex N-series reach trucks are also suitable for cold store applications. A.

Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
