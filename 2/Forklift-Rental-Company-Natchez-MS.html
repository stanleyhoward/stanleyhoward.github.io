The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck.

Since counterbalance forklifts are one of the most widely-used types of powered vehicles in the workplace, they fall under typical OSHA training guidelines.

Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>These IC forklifts are ideal for manufacturing plants and construction sites, where operators need versatility to handle multiple tasks and rugged reliability to navigate rough terrain, unpredictable weather and heavy loads.
