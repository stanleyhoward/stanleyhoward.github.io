The ability to floor-stack a product is based on the stability of the loaded pallet combined with the product's capacity to handle the weight without buckling on itself.">

There are other models that have an auxiliary mast that is mounted in front of the platform with pallet forks. We offer a full line of both new and used trucks, buses and trailers. Drive and operate your rental equipment safely. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for facilities in which employees are in close proximity to forklifts in operation, food-processing and healthcare sectors.</p>

<p>Typically, these types of vehicles are known as forklifts or lift trucks. When you buy a pallet truck then you will come across many varieties in the market.

Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
