Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>Heavy Metal Learning is designed to provide educational content on how to operate heavy equipment; a forum for operators and industry supporters to share their knowledge; an opportunity to get out in the field; and ultimately inspiring the next generation.
