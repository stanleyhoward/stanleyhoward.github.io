<p>Lifted trucks have a negative reputation for being unsafe, but that's simply untrue. This determines how heavy of a load the forklift can handle, and at what different heights. The LHM200SC pallet truck in the BT Lifter L-series is equipped with a scale to provide high-accuracy weighing during the material handling process. Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
